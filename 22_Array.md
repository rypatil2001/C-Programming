# 📌 Arrays in C -

## 1️⃣ What is an Array?

* An **array** is a **derived data type** in **C, C++, and Java**.
* It is used to store **multiple values of the same data type** under a single name.
* All elements are stored in **contiguous (sequential) memory locations**.

---

## 2️⃣ Array as a Data Structure

* An array is internally treated as a **data structure**.
* A **data structure** is a method of organizing and storing data efficiently.

### Types of Data Structures:

1. **Linear Data Structures**

   * Array
   * Linked List  
   * Stack
   * Queue
2. **Non-Linear Data Structures**

   * Tree
   * Graph

✔️ **Array is a Linear Data Structure**

## 3️⃣ Definition of an Array

> An array is a **collection of homogeneous elements**, stored in **sequential memory locations** and accessed using **index values**.

---

## 4️⃣ Key Properties of Arrays

1. Each element occupies **equal-sized memory blocks**.
2. The **index starts from 0**.
3. The **address of the first element** is called the **base address**.
4. Elements are accessed using:

   ```c
   array_name[index]
   ```

---

## 5️⃣ Array Initialization Methods

### (i) Member Initialization List

```c
int Arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```

### (ii) Member-by-Member Initialization

```c
int Arr[5];
Arr[0] = 10;
Arr[1] = 20;
Arr[2] = 30;
Arr[3] = 40;
Arr[4] = 50;
```

---

## 6️⃣ Optional Size with Initialization List

If the array is initialized at declaration time, specifying size is optional.

```c
int Arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```

✔️ Compiler automatically calculates the size.

---

## 7️⃣ Mandatory Size without Initialization

If no initialization list is provided, **size must be specified**.

```c
int Arr[];   // ❌ Compilation error
```

---

## 8️⃣ Array Size Rules

* Size must be a **constant positive integer**.
* **Variables cannot be used as array size in standard C**.

```c
int No = 5;
int Arr[No];   // ❌ Not allowed in standard C
```

> ⚠️ Note: Some compilers support this as a **Variable Length Array (VLA)**, but it is not recommended for beginners.


---

## 9️⃣ Arrays of Different Data Types

Arrays can be created for **any data type except `void`**.

```c
char   cArr[4] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};
int    iArr[4] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
float  fArr[4] = {15.2f, 20.5f, 16.7f, 11.22f};
double dArr[4] = {100.2738, 2738.746, 28933.33474, 8244.4874};
```

---

## 🔟 Corrected & Professional C Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int Arr[4] = {10, 20, 30, 40};

    printf("%d\n", Arr[0]);   // 10
    printf("%d\n", Arr[1]);   // 20
    printf("%d\n", Arr[2]);   // 30
    printf("%d\n", Arr[3]);   // 40

    printf("Size of array: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(Arr));
    printf("Size of one element: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(Arr[0]));

    printf("Base address (Arr)     : %p\n", (void*)Arr);
    printf("Address of Arr         : %p\n", (void*)&Arr);
    printf("Address of Arr[0]      : %p\n", (void*)&Arr[0]);
    printf("Address of Arr[1]      : %p\n", (void*)&Arr[1]);
    printf("Address of Arr[2]      : %p\n", (void*)&Arr[2]);
    printf("Address of Arr[3]      : %p\n", (void*)&Arr[3]);

    return 0;
}
```

---

## 🔑 Important Observations

1. `sizeof(Arr)` → total memory of array

   ```
   4 elements × 4 bytes = 16 bytes
   ```
2. `Arr`, `&Arr`, and `&Arr[0]` **point to the same address**, but their **types differ**.
3. Array name represents the **base address** of the array.
4. Addresses increase by the size of the data type (4 bytes for `int`).

---

## 📌 Automatic Initialization Rule

If fewer values are provided in the initialization list:

```c
int Arr[5] = {10, 20};
```

Result:

```
10  20  0  0  0
```

✔️ This rule applies **only with initialization lists**.
