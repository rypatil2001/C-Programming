# 🚀 C Programming Daily Practice

Welcome to my **C Programming Practice Repository**! 👨‍💻  
This is where I upload my daily C programs as I continue learning and mastering the C language. Whether it’s basic syntax or tricky logic-building, you’ll find a wide variety of standalone programs here.

C programming language was developed in the early 1970s by American computer scientist Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Laboratories. C programming is a Procedural Programming language. C programming is a native programming language. Native means it is close to the microprocessor. Since language is considered as native it is difficult to learn. C is a powerful language. All operating systems are written using C language in (Unix, Linux, Windows, Mac OS)
