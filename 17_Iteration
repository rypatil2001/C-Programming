🔹 Why Iteration is Used : 
To perform repetitive tasks
To reduce code duplication
To process arrays and data structures
To implement menu-driven programs
To improve program clarity and maintainability


🔹 Types of Iteration in C

1️⃣ for Loop
Used when the number of repetitions is known in advance. It combines initialization, condition checking, and update in one statement.

2️⃣ while Loop
Used when the number of repetitions is not known and depends on a condition that is checked before the loop body executes.

3️⃣ do-while Loop
Used when the loop body must execute at least once, because the condition is checked after executing the statements.
